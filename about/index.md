Who We Are
----------
We are a group of students at Southern Polytechnic State University who compete in the AUVSI International Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) Competition. Our goal is to compete with other universities and to provide SPSU students with a creative outlet so they can gain hands-on experience.

We must build an autonomous underwater vehicle for this competition. Our AUV must complete a mission which consists of a set of tasks. We must follow specific rules and our AUV must meet certain requirements. Points will be given for the tasks completed. Points will also be given for our team's website, journal paper, uniform, and AUV. It is also possible to earn bonus points for meeting certain weight requirements.

Meetings
--------
General Meetings are held Fridays at 5:30pm at our lab in room O-106 in the Student Competition Building.
