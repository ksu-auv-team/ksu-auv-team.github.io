                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>Starting in 2004, Southern Polytechnic State University (SPSU) was one of the earliest schools to join Robosubâ€™s AUV.
                    In 2015, SPSU merged with KSU, leading to lost history, but most of SPSU's competition placements have been recovered and recorded.</p>

                <h2>Current</h2>
                <p>The 2023 KSU AUV team is focused on designing a stronger successor to the previous sub, benefiting from a comprehensive review for enhancements.
                    With an expanded team, the KSU AUV now enjoys greater flexibility in distributing tasks and working more efficiently.</p>

                <p>KSU AUV aims for continuous improvement in all aspects, from sub-building to teamwork, promising significant progress this year.
                    The team also plans to create more connections this year among spectators, sponsors, and other schools.</p>

            <h1>About the Organization</h1>
            <p>We are Kennesaw State University's AUV team, comprised of undergraduate students studying Mechanical, Electrical, Computer, Mechatronic engineering, as well as computer science, business, and marketing.</p>

            <p>

                Each year, we participate in Robosub, an engineering competition by Robonation, where we travel to San Diego (when possible) to compete against universities worldwide.
                This provides our team with invaluable real-world engineering experience, networking opportunities, and exposure to research from other participating teams.
            </p>

            <p>
                Our goal is to provide students with a creative outlet, so they can gain hands-on engineering experience, meet other like-minded individuals, and to have fun.

                <h1>What is Robosub</h1>
                <p>Robosub is an annual competition hosted by Robonation that focuses on autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs).
                    Teams from universities worldwide participate in this event to advance AUV technology and promote engineering innovation.
                    During the competition, teams design, build, and operate AUVs capable of completing underwater tasks, including navigation, object manipulation, and communication.</p>

                <p>
                    Robosub provides a valuable platform for participants to gain real-world engineering experience, network with peers and professionals, and access cutting-edge research from other competing teams.
                    The competition drives AUV development, pushing the boundaries of autonomous underwater exploration and technology.
