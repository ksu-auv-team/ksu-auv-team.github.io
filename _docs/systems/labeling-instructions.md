### [Labeling tool](https://ksu-auv-team.github.io/labeling-tool/labeling.html)

Thank you for helping label images! Here's how our labeling tool works:

* Select a class (type of object) by pressing the buttons below the image, then draw a bounding box around the object. (Right now all the classes are different colors of balloon.)

* After you draw all the bounding boxes on an image, click the **Submit** button to save your changes. Only use the **New Image** button if there's nothing to label or you need to skip an image.

* Once you've finished all the images in a dataset or all the images you're labeling, enter your name so we know who you are and click **Download** to get the .txt file of your labels. Send the .txt file to [the form linked on the page](https://goo.gl/forms/i9zQVxzIyPSYcxbm1) so we can use it. **Until you do this, we don't have any of your data.**

* There are multiple datasets - use the button in the top left to change between them.

* Label whole objects, not partial ones.

* Don't label reflections.

* Ignore rubber ducks, frogs, or other objects - we brought those as a test, but you can't see them clearly enough.

* If you make a mistake, use the **undo**, **clear**, or **unSubmit** buttons to fix it.

* Keyboard shortcuts:
    * **Enter** or **Space** to submit an image
    * The **number keys** to select a class
    * **&larr;** and **&rarr;** to move between images without labeling them
    * **z** to undo
