Sometimes we need to work on things, that can not be done remotely, on our embedded systems; but that always required finding a spare monitor, retrieving the needed cables from the storage bin, and put everything back once we are finished. However we found that re-purposing an old computer case (while waiting for a raspi backup image to burn) can be a 'neat' way to ~~hide~~ remove cable clutter.

The workstation is made from the case of a broken PC we had lying around. It contains one network cable, one HDMI to DVI cable, and a KVM switch hooked up to the monitor, keyboard, and mouse next to the case. It has become a useful tool in quickly preforming tasks on the sub's main computer and its Raspberry Pi counterpart.
