October 4th and 5th we will be attending the Atlanta Maker Faire in downtown Decatur. There are two exhibits: Exhibition Area A will be in the large parking lot beside the Calloway Building and Exhibition Area B will be along both sides of N McDonough Street near Decatur High School. The best address to feed your GPS will be: 125 W Trinity Place, Decatur, GA 30030. That will put you at the parking deck right across the street from Exhibition Area A.

The AUV team will be in Exhibition Area B at spot M85. Come by and see us. More information can be found at: http://makerfaireatl.com/
