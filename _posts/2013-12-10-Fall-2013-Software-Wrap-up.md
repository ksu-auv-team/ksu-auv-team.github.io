The majority of the semester the software team has been focused on developing our list of requirements and layout of the system. We have had many setbacks this semester; such as our laptop, which we do the majority of our work on, dying. Despite the setbacks, we ended up becoming ahead of schedule and we were able to develop the movement sub-system, which is ready for testing. 
 
Next semester we plan to develop and test the vision and control sub-systems.
