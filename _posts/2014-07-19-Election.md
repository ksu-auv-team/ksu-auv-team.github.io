For each new competition season, the team elects new officials. The officials elected hold the positions of President, Vice President, Secretary, and Treasurer. The president leads the team, and the vice president is second-in-command. The Secretary facilitates team communcation, manages a calendar of events, and logs team activities. The treasurer handles the finances of the team including purchase requests.

This year, the elections happened on July 18th. Our Mechanical Team leader, Drew Geiman was elected to be President. Albert Cheng, who is part of our Electrical Team, was elected as Vice President. Our previous President, Bennett Stedwell was elected as treasurer. Ada Odey, who is from the Mechanical Team, was elected as the team Secretary.
