We would like to thank one of our sponsors. [Portwell](http://www.portwell.com/) has donated a replacement embedded PC. A while back one of our embedded PC's released the mysterious black smoke and would not boot again. We contacted Portwell, and they responded within the hour and had the new system shipped to us as soon as a new one came off the production line. They have been very friendly and helpful this entire time.
