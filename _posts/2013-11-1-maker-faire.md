We showcased our progress at the 2013 Atlanta Mini Maker Faire at Georgia Tech this year. This year we presented our upgraded thruster testing tank. We added thruster controllers and a cable and pulley system for attendees to find out how powerful a thruster is by pulling on the cable. We also used it to teach the concept of work to the younger attendees. We also had our embedded PC on display running a modified version of our path detecting code. This allowed us to explain the basic processes of developing code for vision based tasks.
