On the first day we took in a lot of new information. We met many new teams and asked many questions, gathering valuable advice and information. We observed a few general trends that were rarely broken, as well as some interesting new concepts and designs. Since none of us had been to the TRANSDEC facility before, seeing it was also a great experience for all of us.
