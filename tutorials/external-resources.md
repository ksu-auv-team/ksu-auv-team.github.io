# External Resources

This is a list of external resources you might find useful. They are by no means the only ones or even necessarily the best ones out there; Google and trying things out are always your best resources.

## Terminal commands

All of these apply to the Unix terminal, but Windows command prompt is similar in principle with some different commands. Learn Unix; it's better.

[Tutorial: Terminal](http://cs.colby.edu/maxwell/courses/tutorials/terminal/)

Basic introduction to the terminal, using only the minimum commands you need. Written for Mac, but applies to all Unix-based OSes.

[Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line)

Interactive command line tutorial

[Learn Enough Command Line to be Dangerous](https://www.learnenough.com/command-line-tutorial)

Very in-depth introduction to the command line, assuming no prior knowledge. Probably overkill for most people - you can start by learning a little bit and pick the rest up as you go along instead.

## Git
