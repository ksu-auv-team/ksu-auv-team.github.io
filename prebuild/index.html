	Our team builds submarine robots to compete in the AUVSI International Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) Competition. Our goal is to compete against other universities and to provide SPSU students with a creative outlet so they can gain hands-on experience.</p>
<p>
	We are competing in the International Autonomous Underwater Vehicle Competition. This competition is co-sponsored by the Office of Naval Research (ONR) and the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International (AUVSI) . The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center San Diego will host this event. The competition will take place from July 12, 2011 to July 17, 2011 at the TRANSDEC Facility in San Diego California.</p>

	We must build an autonomous underwater vehicle for this competition. Our AUV must complete a mission which consists of a set of tasks. We must follow specific rules and our AUV must meet certain requirements. Points will be given for the tasks completed. Points will also be given for our team&#39;s website, journal paper, uniform, and AUV. It is also possible to earn bonus points for meeting certain weight requirements.</p>
